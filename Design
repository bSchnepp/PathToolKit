Generally, we're aiming to have it work along this:
	- Create instance
	- Create frame
	- Create graphics context
	- Create components and their contexts,
	- Bind them all together, define shapes and stuff, put them in.
	
	TODO things that would be nice:
		- Abstract away the creation of a graphics context in a 'BasicFrame' class, which manages it's graphics context by itself.
		- Make a ShapeFactory class
		- Support ellipses as a shape.
