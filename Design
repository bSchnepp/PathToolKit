Generally, we're aiming to have it work along this:
	- Create BasicFrame (or separate graphics context, frame, and instance if you want)
	- Create components and their contexts,
	- Bind them all together, define shapes and stuff, put them in.
	
TODO things that would be nice:
	- Make a ShapeFactory class.
	- Support ellipses as a shape.
	- Support a bunch of variations of shapes.
	- Get around to adding colors other than black and white.
	- Ensure this actually works on Linux. Like, real Linux, not WSL. Actual X out in the wild.
	- Fix the window position thing? Is that a bug? I can't tell if it's just Xming + WSL or if it's me.
	- Make widgets suuuper customizable, load a file from ~/Pathfinder/Theme/theme.ptk (or A:/Users/Brian/Pathfinder/Theme/theme.ptk when I do something with Waypoint beyond just a dummy kernel.)

Aims:
	- Easy to rewrite FreedomWriter using PathToolKit in C++ (since PTK is heavilly inspired by Swing, GTK, and in a way Vulkan, this shouldn't be too hard)
	- Rewrite the GUIs for VulpineGE in PTK, in an effort to stay away from GTK, Cairo, Qt, etc. (Because custom everything is fun, I probably have severe NIHS or something haha.)
	- Write a new graphics editing program, 3D modelling tool (and port Cycles to it), etc, aim to build a full desktop environment from self-created tools. Eventually.
	- Write a new window manager that makes extensive use of Vulkan for rendering. (Disregard that Nouveau doesn't support it, whatever.)
	- Eventually get around to making this not awful. Clean up code, make optimizations, avoid long branching conditions, etc.
