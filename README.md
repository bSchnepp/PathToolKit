# PathToolKit
A simple drawing/widget toolkit, utilizing XCB.
___

PathToolKit is meant to be a simple widget/drawing toolkit that I can just use.
I tend to enjoy making things from scratch, this (as with almost everything else here) is a 'for fun project'.

As usual, things are being designed in a fairly random and currently inconsistent order.
___

Core features (TODO):

	- Vector-based graphics.

	- Support for raster graphics if you really want it.

	- Preference to render surfaces in Vulkan/OpenGL whenever possible.
	
Completed features:

	- Nothing!

Roadmap:
	
	- Connect the color class to actually rendering colors shortly...
	
	- Within 4 months, start getting a Vulkan backend up.
	
	- Complete a real program with PathToolKit in 1 year!
___
PathToolKit also has a sample folder for some programs utilizing the library.
These are located in the 'Samples' folder.
If you're building PathToolKit to be used, you should build the PathToolKit directory by itself, and create a dynamic object from it.

(TODO: make this readme not awful later)
