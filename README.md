# PathToolKit
A simple drawing/widget toolkit, utilizing XCB.
===

PathToolKit is meant to be a simple widget/drawing toolkit that I can just use.
I tend to enjoy making things from scratch, this (as with almost everything else here) is a 'for fun project'.

As usual, things are being designed in a fairly random and currently inconsistent order.
===

Core features (TODO):
	- Vector-based graphics.
	- Support for raster graphics if you really want it.
	- Preference to render surfaces in Vulkan/OpenGL whenever possible.
	- Actually update readme (âœ”)

===
PathToolKit also has a 'test' folder for some programs utilizing the library.
These are located in the 'Samples' folder.
If you're building PathToolKit to be used, you should build the PathToolKit directory by itself, and create a dynamic object from it.

(TODO: make this readme not awful later)
