# PathToolKit
A simple drawing/widget toolkit, utilizing XCB.
___

PathToolKit is meant to be a simple-to-understand but deep in features widget/drawing toolkit that I can just use.
It is a work in progress, with many features, ideas, anything being very fluid and subject to change rather rapdily.
___

Core features (TODO):

	- Vector-based graphics.

	- Support for raster graphics if you really want it.

	- Preference to render surfaces in Vulkan/OpenGL whenever possible.
	
Completed features:

	- Colors. In a bad way.

Roadmap:

	- Within 4 months, start getting a Vulkan backend up.
	
	- Complete a real program with PathToolKit in 1 year!
___
PathToolKit also has a sample folder for some programs utilizing the library.
These are located in the 'Samples' folder.
If you're building PathToolKit to be used, you should build the PathToolKit directory by itself, and create a dynamic object from it.

Some of those examples are expected to be broken as the library is changed over time, and will be updated whenever I can spare the time to fix them.

(TODO: make this readme not awful later)
