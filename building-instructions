I'm **really** lazy with makefiles.
Thus, I build in Eclipse.
I know, vim and gedit and emacs and all, too lazy to bother with a simple project
that's not going anywhere anyway.

So just do this:
	-Load the repo as the source folder in a new project.
	-Set the standard to c++14. (c++1y if your GCC is outdated)
	-Install the following packages:
		-xcb
		-libvulkan-dev
	-Right click on the new project, and link with:
		-xcb
		-vulkan
		-dl	[This is a Linux module which should already be present.]
	- Under the menus where you change the compiler's warning settings, enable all of them except -w (which is the root of all evil), and syntax only.
	- Ensure the option for position independant code is enabled.
	- I optimize with -O3, I'm not fully sure how life works with a different setting.
	
	- Build and work with it.
